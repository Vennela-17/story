  <h3><b><u>Story</u></b></h3>
  <p>In 1920, during the British Raj, Governor Scott Buxton and his wife Catherine visit a forest in Adilabad. There they abduct Malli, an artistically-talented young girl from the Gond tribe. Enraged, the tribe's guardian Komaram Bheem embarks for Delhi to rescue her, disguising himself as a Muslim named Akhtar. Elsewhere, the Nizamate of Hyderabad, sympathetic to the Raj, warns Scott's office of the impending danger. Undeterred, Catherine enlists A. Rama Raju, an ambitious officer in the Indian Imperial Police, to quell the threat. Seeking clues to Malli's whereabouts, Raju and his uncle, Venkateswarulu, attend several pro-independence gatherings where he feigns to support independence.

    Months later, Lachhu, Bheem's gullible aide, believing Raju's ruse, attempts to recruit him into Bheem's plot. Before introducing Raju to Bheem, Lachhu discovers Bheem's identity as a police officer and flees. Shortly after, Bheem and Raju encounter one other, unaware of their opposing allegiances. While working in concert to save a boy from a train wreck, they form a friendship, gradually growing close. Raju assists Bheem in courting Jenny, Scott's niece, unaware that Bheem plans to infiltrate Scott's residence. ("Naacho Naacho" dance number.) When Jenny takes Bheem to her residence, Bheem locates the room where Malli is held captive; he promises Malli to free her. Meanwhile, Raju deduces Lachhu's true identity and apprehends him. While being interrogated, Lachhu goads a banded krait into attacking Raju, then warns him of his imminent fate and that the antidote is only known to the Gonds.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Dazed, Raju approaches Bheem, who immediately tends to him. Noticing similar religious features between Lachhu and Bheem, Raju deduces his true intentions. Nevertheless, Bheem divulges his tribal identity and his mission, still unaware of Raju's true identity. At an event to honor Scott, Bheem's men barge into his residence with a lorry filled with wild animals, creating havoc among the guests. The animals maul Scott's guards, allowing Bheem to briefly fight; however, Raju arrives and tells him Scott intends to kill Malli; he surrenders out of obligation. In the aftermath, Raju is promoted for thwarting Bheem, yet he is guilt-stricken over his actions, recalling his own pro-nationalistic background and his alter-ego as a mole within the police; he sought a promotion to gain access to gun shipments to smuggle to his village.

        At Bheem's public flogging, Raju attempts to persuade him to recant his actions; Bheem chooses flogging instead. Bheem sings in defiance of his injuries, which incites the assembled crowd into rebellion. The riot further enlightens Raju, who finally recognizes his reckless actions. Determined to save his friend, he persuades Scott to execute Bheem in secrecy, while Raju prepares an ambush to rescue Bheem. Scott figures out the scheme. While rescuing Malli from Scott's men, Raju is grievously injured. Bheem, who freed himself, mistakenly interprets Raju's actions as an attempt to kill Malli; he bludgeons him and escapes with her. Months later, Bheem, who is hiding with his group and Malli in Hathras, is cornered by the colonial authorities. He narrowly avoids being exposed when Sita, Raju's fianc√©e, repels them by claiming there is smallpox epidemic.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Unaware of Bheem's identity, she reveals Raju's anti-colonial objectives and his impending execution. Crestfallen upon realizing his own folly, Bheem vows to save him. With Jenny's sympathetic assistance, Bheem infiltrates the barracks where Raju is detained and frees him. The pair retreat to a nearby forest, where they decimate soldiers with a longbow taken from a Rama shrine. Taking the fight to Scott, they hurl a flaming motorcycle into the barracks' magazines, setting it afire. Bheem steals a cache of guns for Raju before the barracks is destroyed. The subsequent explosion kills many within Scott's company, including Catherine. Having cornered a wounded Scott, Raju has Bheem execute him with a British rifle, fulfilling their respective objectives. Ram is reunited with Sita, and Bheem is reunited with Jenny and his family.

        To mark the mission's successful completion, Raju asks Bheem to make a wish he can grant; Bheem asks Raju to provide education for him and his community.</p>
