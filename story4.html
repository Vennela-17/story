  <h3><b><u>Story</u></b></h3>
  <p>Ram Prasad and Lakshman "Lucky" Prasad are brothers and polar opposites. While the former is an honorable ACP, the latter is a happy-guy who is constantly at odds with his brother. Madhali Shiva Reddy is a mercenary turned politician. He holds a squad of police officers at gunpoint, and forces Rajeev to kill his commanding officer, ACP Sameer, to save the lives of the rest of the officers. Ram is motivated to prevent Shiva Reddy's participation in the upcoming elections.

    One day, Lucky meets Spandana, daughter of Bheem Prakash, in an elevator. He notices that she doesn't react to anything, maintaining the same expression and remaining calm no matter what happens. When she refuses to look scared during a bank robbery, even after being threatened with a gun, Lucky asks her why she is like this. Spandana says that she feels all emotions 'inside'. Her father, Bheem Prakash, taught her to be in control of her emotions. Lucky, who has fallen in love with Spandana, calls it rubbish, and vows to bring a change in her.</p>
  <br>
  <p>After meeting Lucky on a regular basis, she learns to show her emotions and reciprocates his love. Ram learns of Lucky's relationship and informs Prakash that his daughter is roaming with a lazy and spoilt guy as retribution for a previous prank. Prakash instantly dislikes Lucky, and tells him that he cannot marry his daughter. Lucky and Ram have a serious fight, where Lucky is slapped by his mother for the first time. Shaken and enraged, he steals Ram's jeep, in which Ram was transporting files that incriminated Shiva Reddy in numerous crimes. Lucky is then attacked by Shiva Reddy's men, who mistake him to be Ram, and the Jeep goes up in flames along with the files. Lucky beats up the goons, who try to tell him that they were planning to murder Ram. Upon hearing this, Lucky is enraged. He kidnaps Shiva Reddy and beats him up, tying him upside down to a tree. Shiva Reddy is hospitalized.

    Lucky then visits Shiva Reddy's father Peddi Reddy and confesses. He talks about how he used to hate his brother, but has now realized that he loves his brother very much, which was why he reacted the way he did. Peddi Reddy motivates Shiva Reddy to attack and take revenge on Lucky. Lucky decides to reunite Ram with the woman he used to love, so that Ram would not interfere with his love story. After a few hilarious twists, his plan works.
    
    After recovering and being elected as an MLA, Shiva Reddy uses his influence and starts to take revenge on Lucky and his family. He gets Ram suspended by paying a woman to claim that she was harassed by Ram, and has the government demolish the family's house, claiming that it was illegally built. Ram is then informed that it was Lucky that stole his Jeep. Ram is furious and kicks Lucky out of the family after berating him for what his mistake has cost them.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Lucky is abducted by Shiva Reddy, who brutally beats him and leaves him hanging from the same tree Lucky hung him from. Lucky escapes and plans to take revenge with the help of Home Minister Govardhan, who owes Lucky for his promotion from MLA to Home Minister. Lucky fools Govardhan by convincing him he is suffering from cancer and has only one day to live. Govardhan says he will grant any wish Lucky asks, and Lucky requests to be instated as a special officer and asks Govardhan to do a solitary 12-hour ritual for Lucky's survival. Govardhan agrees. Lucky is in charge of a team of police officers including Kill Bill Pandey, a frustrated police officer who takes the lead and helps Lucky destroy Shiva Reddy's properties, not knowing Lucky is a fake police officer. Lucky sends Pandey to Shiva Reddy in person to get a list of his factories under the pretense that they'll know which factories to not raid. Using the list and the media, the special forces team invades and exposes Shiva Reddy's illegal operations. Govardhan's prayer finishes and after the CM scolds him of his mistake, Govardhan seeks Ram's help.

    Lucky fights and defeats Shiva Reddy, but after he cuffs him, Ram appears and cuffs Lucky. Govardhan and the CM want to publicly hang Lucky for his illegal actions and for humiliating them, but Ram tells them that people wouldn't take well to killing the man who exposed Shiva Reddy. He reveals that the public was planning to re-elect the same government in the next elections. Lucky uses this opportunity and convinces (aka blackmails) the CM and Govardhan to continue this special-force team and give police officers full powers. Shiva Reddy is shot to death by Rajeev. Lucky and Ram reunite with their family.</p>
